# Voting Demo
We're making a demo that utilizes blockchain technology to help create a decentralized voting platform. This system removes the annonymity aspect of other blockchain systems. The easy-to-use interface includes features such as:
* **Weighted Votes** - users with more power or higher stakes have higher weighted votes
* **Local Tally** - real-time tallies are performed at each node, so users can easily see where the vote is headed
* **Ease of Access** - the extremely low barrier of entry to this system means that anyone can benefit from it. Little understanding of blockchains or coding is required (once we're done, that is.)

#Getting Started
idk how this code works so this will be fun!
